# marinahacks-discordbot
MarinaHacks' discord bot is used for giving roles to new discord users on the MarinaHacks discord server. It uses a personal MongoDB database to determine what role new users are assigned to.
### How to set-up environment
1. Open terminal and enter these installations
 `pip install discord`, `pip install pymongo`, `pip install python-dotenv`
2. Ask author (jesusdonate) for the discord bot token and database token. The tokens should be named DISCORD_TOKEN and DATABASE_TOKEN and should be stored inside of a .env file. Make sure .env is in .gitignore. If not, type `.env` inside of it and save file. DO NOT HARD CODE THE TOKENS SINCE THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC AND OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USERS WILL SEE IT!!!

Note: If you want access to the MongoDB database, ask me to invite you to the project.
